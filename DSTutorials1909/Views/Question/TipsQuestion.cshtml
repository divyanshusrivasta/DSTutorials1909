    <h1>How to Write a Good Question</h1>
    <h3>Stay On-Topic:</h3>
    <p>
        Make sure your question is about programming and is written in English. If it's off-topic, it might be closed. Closure is temporary, and you can revise your question to meet the requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Research First:</h3>
    <p>
        Before writing, spend some time researching your problem. Check if similar questions already have answers. If you can't find a solution, include links to related questions when you write.
    </p>

    <h3>Write a Clear Title:</h3>
    <p>Summarize your problem in the title. Pretend you're explaining it to a busy colleague in one sentence.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bad:</strong> "JavaScript Help Needed"</li>
        <li><strong>Good:</strong> "Why isn't my JavaScript function executing when called inside a loop?"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Introduce the Problem:</h3>
    <p>
        Start by describing your problem in words before sharing code. Provide context and explain how you encountered the issue. Make your first paragraph engaging and informative.
    </p>

    <h3>Help Others Reproduce:</h3>
    <p>
        If code is involved, include only what's necessary for others to reproduce the problem. Post images of code/errors if needed.
    </p>

    <h3>Proofread Before Posting:</h3>
    <p>
        Read through your question to ensure it makes sense. Pretend you're seeing it for the first time. Check for spelling and grammar errors.
    </p>

    <h3>Respond to Feedback:</h3>
    <p>
        After posting, stay around for a bit. Respond to comments, try suggested solutions, and provide feedback. You can edit your question at any time.
    </p>

    <h3>Look for Help:</h3>
    <p>
        If your question receives poor feedback, don't worry. Learning to write good questions takes time. Use additional resources and consider seeking help on how to improve your asking skills.
